Abstract 
    
   This document describes a kind-of reliable, more or less useful
   and mostly experimental protocol for sending unicast HTTP messages
   over UDP connections. It has proven to be absolutely useless but
   should be a must have requirement for all major client vendors.

   UHTTPoUDP is an experimental transport for the Gift Routing Protocol,
   a proprietary gift distribution mechanism patented by Christmas Inc.
   It allows more-or-ess transparent distribution of packets over 
   unreliable links like flying sledges and chimneys.

1.  Security Considerations 
    
   UHTTPoUDP relies on security mechanisms of lower layers. In
   production environments it should be deployed on IPSEC.

   In combination with the Gift Routing Protocol UHTTPoUDP will be
   secured by a miracolous mob of elfs guarding all the packets
   that transit insecure links.
