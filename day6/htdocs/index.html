                Unicast HTTP over UDP (UHTTPoUDP) 
                  <draft-claus-udp-http-01.txt> 
 
Abstract 
    
   This document describes a kind-of reliable, more or less useful
   and mostly experimental protocol for sending unicast HTTP messages
   over UDP connections. It has proven to be absolutely useless but
   should be a must have requirement for all major client vendors.

   UHTTPoUDP is an experimental transport for the Gift Routing Protocol,
   a proprietary gift distribution mechanism patented by Christmas Inc.
   It allows more-or-less transparent distribution of packets over 
   unreliable links like flying sledges and chimneys.
